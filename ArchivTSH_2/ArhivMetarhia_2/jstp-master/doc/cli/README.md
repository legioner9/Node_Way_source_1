# CLI

JSTP comes bundled with an interactive REPL that allows you to interact with
JSTP servers for testing or debugging purposes, much like you use curl or
Postman to interact with HTTP servers.
To install it globally, run:

```shell
npm install -g @metarhia/jstp
```

You can then use it by running `jstp-cli` command with the
needed options. To get a basic help message, you can run:

```shell
jstp-cli --help
```

To get more detailed information on how to use the tool and the list of
all available options, use:

```shell
man jstp-cli
```
